# TerminalAF
An unecessarily bright and intoxicatingly rad super dope setup for looking extra cool while you're doing terminal stuff on Zoom in front of other people ;)

# Dependencies (because I can't spell prerequesitsises...?)
In order to make your terminal look cooler than everybody elses, you're gonna need the following:

1. ![Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) because stock terminals are for babies
2. Some ![Alacritty themes](https://github.com/eendroroy/alacritty-theme), I'm using tokyo-night
3. ![Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) because lots of smart people use it and you'll feel smarter if you use it
4. Tmux because I said so
5.  The Tmux Plugin Manager or ![tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for short
6. ![NvChad](https://nvchad.com/), or whatever Neovim setup you prefer
7. A ![Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), I use SauceCodePro

You're also gonna need about 15 minutes to follow the preceeding setup guide because I'm just not cool enough to make a one-liner :(

# OSX setup
